# Friend-Finder

Friend Finder is a compatibility-based web application for finding a friend or "date".     The user provides their answers to a series of 10 questions on a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 indicates strong disagreement and 5 indicates strong agreement.  A name and photo are also required.  Friend finder then compares the user responses to that of all other "friends" in the database to determine the best Match.  A pop-up window displays the name and a photo of the best match for the user.


## About
Friend Finder is a full-stack website that utilizes Node Express and Javascript to set up the server on the back-end including the required middleware and routers.  The front-end javascript files use jQuery for GET and POST requests to the server.  Bootstrap 4 is used both to style the website as well as to provide the functionality for the modal popup.
